        <h1>Attack your goals like your life depends on it. </h1>
        <p>Every species is important to the health of an ecosystem. Removing one species can weaken a habitat, but if a keystone species is removed, an entire ecosystem could collapse. If large predators such as lions disappeared, herd populations would balloon, and grazers would eat up the grass. </p>

        <h1>Well as giraffes say, you don't get no leaves unless you stick your neck out.</h1>
        <p>Current giraffe numbers mean the IUCN classifies the animals as a species of ‘least concern’.But if the results of the study above lead to the total giraffe population being split between four species, the adjustment could lead to one or more of them being classified as species under threat.</p>

        <h1>Cats are connoisseurs of comfort.</h1>
        <p>Cats can be lethal hunters and very sneaky, when they walk their back paws step almost exactly in the same place as the front paws did beforehand, this keeps noise to a minimum and limits visible tracks.</p>

        <h1>The smallest feline is a masterpiece</h1>
        <p>Domestic cats love to play, this is especially true with kittens who love to chase toys and play fight. Play fighting among kittens may be a way for them to practice and learn skills for hunting and fighting.</p>

        <h1> The wolf on the hill is never as hungry as the wolf climbing the hill.</h1>
        <p>Wolves are legendary because of their spine-tingling howl, which they use to communicate. A lone wolf howls to attract the attention of his pack, while communal howls may send territorial messages from one pack to another. Some howls are confrontational. Calls may be answered by rival packs. Much like barking domestic dogs, wolves may simply begin howling because a nearby wolf has already begun</p>
